# VehicleChain application

Vehicle chain is an application, which helps people with buying second hand cars. Worried about hidden info? All data is now written to ethereum block chain.
Every car gets its own address. We can save data about mileage, services and insurance. Some data is private, but most of it is public.
To check data about cars, users only need car addresses.

## Smart contracts

### Mileage
Mileage is entered yearly by manager at AMZS. Anyone can check milage info of any car in the network.
